# CoronaTracker
This project is to build an application to track covid-19 close contacts within last 14 days for a covid-19 positive patient 

# Background
Humanity is in crisis due to covid-19 global outbreak which is already declared as a pandemic. This is high time we need to get the best of our technology to solve parts of this global crisis. One of the most difficult challenges for any government of the affected counties is to flatten the curve of infection. Early detection of already affected patients is the most important part to flatten the curve. When a patient is identified as covid-19 positive, government is trying to get close contacts of the patient following manual steps by asking to the friends and family members and so on. However, this approach has many limitations in terms of information accuracy retrieval duration due to,

1. Falsified information from F&F
2. Hidden information by Family to avoid social embarrassment
3. Unknown or missing information of the patient
4. Delayed retrieval of information due to manual processes
5. And many more

# Idea: How Technology can help?
1. An application can be developed within short time which will be running in most of the popular platforms (Android, iOS).
2. Bangladeshi government need to enforce the installation of this application to all its citizen as part of civil duty. Deployment policy and strategy can be devised after more analysis. Operator like, GP, Robi, BL can be useful.
3. All the close contact data of all citizen will be stored in a central or distributed server.
4. The application will use GPS (Global Positioning System) to detect all the loose contacts and close contacts of the citizens and store the histories in data server for last couple of weeks (i.e. >14 days, configurable).

# How the app will work
We know most of the time we keep our smartphones with us even when we talk to other, gather, hangout, dine and attend any festivals. If the app is ideally installed in all the smartphones of the citizen. Close contacts for a certain duration (i.e. more than 2/3 ~ 5/10 mins) can be easily detected by GPS and immediately logged into server. Later if one of the citizen is identified covid-19 positive, government can find the full close contact tree with even other detail information like (contact duration, distance, time and place). That would be off course a very accurate information for the government to identify the candidates for quarantine and further immediate testing.
